Weather Forecasting Using ARIMA and Holt-Winters
Project Overview
This project aims to forecast temperature data using two time series forecasting models:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Used to forecast monthly temperature data. (Converted from daily data using the freq function.)
Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing: Applied to forecast daily temperature data.
The goal is to provide a robust solution for predicting future temperature values based on historical data using these two models.

The following libraries are required for running this project:

pandas: For handling and analyzing data.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For plotting graphs.
statsmodels: For building the ARIMA and Holt-Winters models.
joblib: For saving and loading models.
streamlit: For creating a user-friendly web application.

Data
Daily Temperature Data
The daily temperature data is used for training and forecasting using the Holt-Winters model. The data contains daily temperature records over multiple years, expected to have a Date column and a Temperature column.

Monthly Temperature Data
The monthly temperature data is derived from the daily data using the freq function, which resamples the data to a monthly frequency, making it suitable for ARIMA forecasting.

Forecasting Techniques
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for Monthly Data
ARIMA is a time series forecasting method that models the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations. It is used for forecasting monthly temperature data by resampling the daily data into monthly frequency using the freq function.

Model Parameters: (p, d, q) for ARIMA (where p = autoregressive order, d = degree of differencing, and q = moving average order).
Training: ARIMA is trained on monthly temperature data to capture trends.
Forecasting: Once trained, ARIMA forecasts future monthly temperatures based on observed patterns.
Holt-Winters for Daily Data
The Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing method is used for forecasting daily temperature data. It accounts for both trends and seasonality, making it suitable for time series with cyclical patterns such as daily temperatures.

Model Parameters: Trend (additive), Seasonal (additive), Seasonal Periods (365 days for yearly seasonality).
Training: The Holt-Winters model is trained on daily data to identify trends and seasonal variations.
Forecasting: The trained model is used to forecast future daily temperatures.
Streamlit Web Application
The project includes a Streamlit app for interactive forecasting. The app allows users to:

Upload their own temperature data (daily format).
Select the number of days to forecast.
Display forecasted temperature values.
Visualize the original data along with the forecast.
Running the Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
Usage
Pre-trained Models
The project comes with pre-trained models:

holt_winters_model.joblib: For daily temperature data.
arima_model.joblib: For monthly temperature data.
Forecasting with Streamlit:
Upload a CSV file with daily temperature data.
Choose the number of days to forecast.
The forecasted data will be displayed, along with a plot of the original data and the forecast.
Performance Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which calculates the average of the absolute differences between the actual and forecasted temperatures. A lower MAE indicates better forecasting performance.

Conclusion
This project provides an end-to-end solution for weather forecasting. By using ARIMA for monthly data and Holt-Winters for daily temperature data, users can easily forecast future temperature values with high accuracy.

Notes
Ensure your input data is formatted correctly (i.e., DD-MM-YYYY for date format).
The monthly data is derived from daily data, resampled using the freq function to fit the ARIMA model.
